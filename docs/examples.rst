MSL-LoadLib Examples
====================

The examples are currently only supported in Windows and Linux simply because the :ref:`C++ <cpp-lib>`,
:ref:`FORTRAN <fortran-lib>` and :ref:`C# <dotnet-lib>` libraries have only been compiled in these
operating systems. The :ref:`kernel32 <tutorial_stdcall>` example is only valid on Windows, since it
uses the ``__stdcall`` calling convention.
